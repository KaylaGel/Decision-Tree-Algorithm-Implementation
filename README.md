# Decision-Tree-Algorithm-Implementation
Implementation of a decision tree algorithm built from scratch for 31005 - Machine Learning. 

GOAL
---
The goal of this project was to build build an algorithm using the ID3 decision tree. The program will compare the accuracy results of the Palmer Penguins and Iris dataset against the ID3 model with the sklearn classifier.

# Running the model

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

## Install requirements 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the program 
```bash
